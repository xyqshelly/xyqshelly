I'm an undergraduate computer science student studying at the University of Alberta. I'm expected to graduate in Spring 2022. <br>
My experience has been broadly focused in software development, but I am constantly exploring new fields.

Check out our latest [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12524.pdf) where we investigated the use of ensembles of Markov chains for procedurally generating Mega Man levels.
