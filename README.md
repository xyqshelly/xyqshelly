### Nice to see you! <img src="/src/github-gif.gif" height="40">

I'm a computer science student studying at the University of Alberta. I'm expected to graduate in Spring 2022. <br>
My experience has been broadly focused in software engineering, but I am constantly exploring new fields.

Feel free to contact me via email at yuqing6@ualberta.ca.
